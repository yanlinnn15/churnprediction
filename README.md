Developing an ensemble model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with other machine learning models helps address the big problem of high churn rates in the telecom industry. When customers leave, telecom companies lose a lot of revenue, and bringing in new customers or keeping existing ones can be expensive. By creating a model that predicts which customers are most likely to leave, telecom companies can take action to keep them. Traditional machine learning models sometimes miss complex patterns in customer data, so adding CNN to the model improves its ability to spot these patterns.

CNN is great at identifying detailed patterns in data, while machine learning models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting are strong at making accurate predictions from structured data. By combining these two approaches, the ensemble model takes advantage of the strengths of both. This leads to better accuracy in predicting which customers are likely to churn. With this improved accuracy, telecom companies can focus on the customers most at risk of leaving and take steps to retain them, reducing the overall churn and saving costs.

**Dataset Description**
Cell2cell dataset consist of wide range of features, such as information on demographics, pattern of usage, subscription to service, call information, and account characteristic. There are 51, 047 instances and 58 attributes.

**EDA and Dataset Preprocessing**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a important step in data pre-processing, as it helps gain insights and understanding of the dataset. Data pre-processing is crucial for model performance, as the quality of data directly impacts the model's accuracy and effectiveness. EDA can help in identifying the missing value, dropping the irrelevant variables, and data transformation to effectively pre-process the data.
